# Text-Compete-2

This is the Kaggle contest notebook from this contest https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021.

This notebook gave me 1843/2060 place. It's far from the leading, public Kaggle notebooks, but my goal was to get a good feel for NER, and I created the entire notebook (minus some hyperparameters) from scratch. I had some ideas to improve my result, but it would not give me a new experience, and this competition was abandoned.
